### 1. Introduction to JavaScript Types
JavaScript has seven data types: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, undefined, null, and symbols.

In some languages you need to specifically declare data types, but JavaScript is dynamic, which means you do not need to explicitly declare the type.

#### `typeof` function
You can check the type of any piece of data by using the `typeof` keyword. For example, `typeof 'test'` would return `'string'`, and `typeof 5` would return `'number'`.

#### Type Coercion
Watch out for type coercion - if you mix two pieces of data that are different types, the JavaScript engine may try to change them both to the same type behind the scenes.
