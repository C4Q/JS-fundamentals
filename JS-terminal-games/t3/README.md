# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
You'll be writing a basic terminal game in JavaScript where you can play tic-tac-toe against another person. X's and O's are placed on a 3x3 grid and the first player to get three in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins. Let's think about some of the game logic next.

## Game Logic
* Game State
  - How are you going to keep track of which squares are empty and which squares have an X or an X placed on them?
* Displaying the Board
  - How are you going to render or display the board?
* Making a Move
  - How will you process a player making a move? (i.e. what buttons should they click?)
* Keeping Track of Player Turn
  - How will you know whose turn it is at any given point in time?
* Checking for End Game
  - After every turn you should check to see if there is a winner, otherwise there is no point continuing the game.
